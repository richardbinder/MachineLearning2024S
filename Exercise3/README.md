## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `maps/`: Contains the maps used in the project and the code to load them and run them in a simulation.
    -  `map_*`: We created a folder for each map, where each contains a script to generate the map and a picture of the map (generated by the script). For better understanding check the directory `map_a`. All maps are saved in the `saved_track` folder as `.npy` files.
    - `saved_track/`: Contains the saved maps in `.npy` format.
    - `game_environment.py`: Contains the environment class that is used to run the simulation. For verification purposes, we can run the environment with random actions with the command `python game_environment.py`. However, to change the map we have to change the `track` to the desired map.:

    ```python
        # Example of how to run the environment with map a
        race_track = RaceTrack(track_dir='./saved_tracks/', track='a', size=20)

        # Example of how to run the environment with map b
        race_track = RaceTrack(track_dir='./saved_tracks/', track='b', size=20)

        # Example of how to run the environment with map c
        race_track = RaceTrack(track_dir='./saved_tracks/', track='c', size=20)
    ```
- `policies`:
    - `soft_behavior_policy.py`: Contains the function soft_policy, which defines a soft behavior policy for the agents in the simulation.
    - `off_policy_montecarlo.py`: Implements the off-policy Monte Carlo control algorithm used for training the agents. 
- `results/`: Directory intended to store the results of the simulations, such as reward histories and policy evaluations.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the training and evaluation of the policies. This script handles the overall flow of the project, including training the policies and generating evaluation plots. Take into account to change the following variables in order to run the desired map and number of episodes:
    ```python
        train = False # True for training and generation of the matrix Q, False for evaluation and generation of the plots for each initial state
        track_dir = "./maps/saved_tracks/" # Directory were tracks are saved
        track = 'a' # Track name (a,b,c)
        total_episodes = 10000 # Total number of episodes
    ```
